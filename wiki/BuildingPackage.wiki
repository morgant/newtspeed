#summary Instructions for building the Newtspeed package from the Mac NTK project files.
#labels Phase-Implementation

== Using Mac OS X ==

You will need:

  * Mac OS X w/Xcode installed
  * Mac OS 9 or earlier w/Mac NTK 1.6.4 installed (either a physical Mac w/TCP/IP AppleShare or an emulator w/mountable shared directory)

On your Mac OS X machine:

  # Launch /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app.
  # Check out the source code using Subversion:
    `svn checkout http://newtspeed.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ newtspeed`
  # Open the project directory:
    `open newtspeed`
  # Mount the Classic Mac OS volume (either network or shared folder) and create a new folder on it named "Newtspeed".
  # Drag the each of the individual project files over, one at a time, to the "Newtspeed" folder on the mounted volume. _This is necessary to properly stitch the resource forks back together._

On your Mac OS 9 (or earlier) machine (or emulator):

  # Double-click on the "Newtspeed" project to open it in Newton Toolkit.
  # Select Project -> Build Package to build the package file.
